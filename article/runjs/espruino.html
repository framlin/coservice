<h1>Espruio as a Board</h1>
</header>
<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>There is a company, that designs and produces little break-boards that have an .....XYZ.....-processor 
with the Espruino-Runtime preinstalled.</p>

<p>This board has two buttons and three LEDs on it, to mak it possible, to play a bit with it.</p>

<h2>Connection</h2>

<p>In their promotion the makers of espruino designate it as IoJ (Internet of Javascript), targeting the hyped phrase IoT.
So the espruino has to be connected to the rest of the world especially the Internet.</p>

<p>Out of the Box the board has to be conected via USB with a PC. 
The board is a prototype-board, so there are many solderpoints to solder a WIFI- or a BLE-module onto the espruino 
and the builtin Javascript-library has the functionality to use this for wireless connections.</p>

<h1>Espruino as a JavaScript-Interpreter</h1>
</header>
<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>This interpreter knows a subset of JavaScript. It is written in C and is designed to work with a very tiny amount of memory.
Espruino cames along with a Javascript-library, that enables one to acces every component of the board (e.g. th eLEDs and the buttons)</p>
