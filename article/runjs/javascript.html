<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>As far as I know, JavaScript is the most used language - not only - in the web. 10 years ago, prior to "Web 2.0" 
and AJAX, leading to webapps, there was only a small number of books about JavaScript out here. <br />
This has changed dramatically and there is nothing, I could write more or better than any of these authors. I am pretty sure, there is a book, 
that fulfills your needs or your niche.</p>

<p>For those that don't like books and doesn't like, to go to far into deep, this is a brief overview about the language. </p>

<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>20 Years ago, in 1995, Brendon Eich was hired by Netscape as a scheme developer and was instructed, to develop an 
interpreted scripting-language, that should have a Java-like syntax and has to run embedded within Netscapes 
WWW-Browser Navigator. <br />
So he implemented JavaScript within 10 days in May 1995.</p>

<p>He designed "Mocha" - as it was named at first - as  a multi-paradigm language, 
that combines the object-oriented aspects expressed by self and the function model of scheme.</p>

<p>Self is inspired by smalltalk. It replaces the classes and the inheritance of smalltalk with a 
prototype-based object model. <br />
Scheme is a combination of the actor-model with the functional programming language LISP.</p>

<p>This paradigm-mixture combined with the event-loop, that was inspired by HyperCard/HyperTalk, 
is - in my opinion - the reason for the success of the language.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a C-style-language. So it has common condition- and flow-structures, like for-loops, 
if-statements and so on, in a C-like-syntax. This is taken over from Java and it's dangerous, 
because not everything, that looks like a duck, behaves like a duck, as one can see looking at the 
keyword "this" or the scoping..  </p>

<p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language, that means, it has types, but they are dynamic. 
There are primitives, objects and functions, where functions are actual objects.
That's all.</p>

<p>The Primitives are: Number, Boolean, String, null and undefined.
They all - except null and undefined - have equivalent object-wrappers as builtin objects.</p>

<h1 id="objects">Objects</h1>
</header>
<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>Besides the primitives, objects are the only "things" JavaScript knows about. <br />
Objects are collections of <strong>properties</strong>, representing virtues by referencing <strong>objects</strong>, 
and behaviour while pointing to <strong>functions</strong>.</p>

<p>Classes as e.g. used by Java, are descriptions, how objects are structured and how they behave. 
Such a description serves as a blueprint, to create and instantiate objects. <br />
To make classes reusable, it is possible to declare, that a class is derived from another and that it is inheriting
the virtue and behavior from the parent-class. </p>

<p>JavaScript does <em>not</em> have such a class-concept. JavaScript has only "living" objects. You can create an object 
and change its properties dynamically at runtime. To target reusability, JavaScript relies 
on <strong>delegation</strong>, instead of inheritance. There are several ways, how to deal with this in detail. 
They use the dynamic nature of objects and/or the <strong>prototype</strong>-property, to reach  it. </p>

<p>In combination with <strong>closures</strong>, it is possible, to express all the concepts 
(like modularisation, information hiding, reusability ....), that are known from OO-languages like Java, and more.</p>

<h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>
</header>
<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>Functions in JavaScript are different, if one is used to the C-style function concept.
On the one hand, JavaScript-functions look and behave like "normal" functions.</p>

<pre>
function foo(bla) {
    return bla;
}
var blubb = foo(42); //blubb == 42
</pre>

<p>But on the other hand, they look and behave like normal objects - because they are normal objects</p>

<pre>
function Thing(value) {
    this.kind = value;
}
var entity = new Thing(42); //entity.kind == 42
</pre>

<p>This is, why I like to call JavaScript an 'object-functional' language. </p>

<h2 id="this">this</h2>

<p>"this" is the next different point. It refers not always to the object, a function <em>belongs to</em>, 
but depends on how a function is called. </p>

<ul>
<li>for new "this" is a new created object </li>
<li>for function call "this" is global object</li>
<li>for method call "this" is the object, the method belongs to</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes JavaScript very flexible, but can be great in causing confusion, too.</p>

<h2 id="closures">closures</h2>

<p>The most important feature of JavaScript are closures. Closures are a kind of lexical (or static) scopes.
They enable functions, to give their static environment a private piggyback ride. 
This is a very useful feature particularly for callbacks, a central element within the <em>event-driven</em> runtime-concept. <br />
Closures are used to realize the module pattern, too.</p>
