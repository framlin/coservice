<p>First to say, there is no need to use express. As I'am a flatiron-user, I figured out, that there is a 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatiron-passport">passport-module for flatiron</a>, too.</p>

<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>For authentication with a so called 'local strategy' you need to store a user-profile - with at least username and pasword - on your server.
One possible solution should be levelDB and therefor the npm-package <em>level</em>, that means <em>levelup</em> together with <em>leveldown</em>, 
but my first try on using it sucked :-(</p>

<p>Because I never used <em>levelup</em> before, I checked out <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/levelmeup">"Level Me Up Scotty!"</a> 
on <a href="nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a>. <br />
I had installed iojs 1.0.5 at that time and ended up reading install error messages concerning node-gyp and other crap like that. <br />
However, some tests with nodejs 0.10.25 succeeded, so I decided to put iojs away, until they have fixed that and to
go back to the "official" nodejs.</p>

<h1 id="passwordencryption">Password encryption</h1>
</header>
<!-- startSectionBody-->
<p>If we don't want to transport a password in plain text over the net we may compute a (md5) hash 
from the password and use that for transport, authentication and storage.</p>

<p>So one question is: Is this necessary or even a good idea and - if so - how can we compute a hash within the browser.</p>

<p>The answer to the if-question is: "it depends". If there is a "man in the middle", 
it might be easier to him, to use a detected password, if its not "uglyfied" as a hash, but if he knows, that this is the password-hash,
that is stored and used, it should make no huge difference.</p>

<p>To answer the how-question: there are a few libraries, that provide well-known crypto-algorithms, implemented in JavaScript.
The most popular seems to be <a href="https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/">crypto-js</a>.</p>

<p>But if you really need transport-security, its best to use a end-to-end encryption like the built-in <em>secure socket layer</em> (SSL, https).</p>

<p>Concerning the storage and the usage for authentication, maybe it is a good idea, to hash the password and
use the hash, to make it harder to spoof your site, but its still a security hole.</p>

<p>So, like I said, it depends. To achieve a normal "day by day" security, that makes it just harder for normal people, to read stuff, 
they are not supposed to, it may be a good compromise, to send plain passwords over the net and store their hashes.</p>
